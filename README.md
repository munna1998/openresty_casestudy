# openresty_casestudy
- Used AWS CLI for provisioning ec2 instance with ubuntu xenial 
- Familiar with ubuntu, hence the choice
- Used Ansible to install openresty and docker
- Ansible was executed in local mode
- Dockerized the webserver application
- Used AWS CLI to configure security group

Note:
- specific IP addresses were not mentioned in the requirement spec. I set up the security group such that it allows http traffic from all IP addresses
